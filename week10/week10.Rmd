**ANOVA assignment** 

This is a continuation of the material submitted for the **Bivariate Graphing Assignment** submitted in week09.  You should revise your assignment as needed based on peer comments.  I encourage everyone to make an appointment with the writing center and to have the writing center review your current assignment.

**Grading Rubric:**

Does the document have sections that explain the `Purpose of the Study` (0.1), the `Variables` used in the study (0.1), and how the data was managed (0.1)? 

Are there graphs for at least two of the categorical variables? (0.1) Is there a sentence or two describing what the reader is viewing? (0.1)  

Is there either a histogram or density plot of one of the numeric variables proposed in the study? (0.1)

Is there a bivariate graph of the principal constructs the researcher is proposing to study? (0.1)  Is there a sentence or two describing what the reader is viewing? (0.1)

Is there a multivariate graph of the principal constructs the researcher is proposing to study? (0.1) Is there a sentence or two describing what the reader is viewing? (0.1)

Do all graphs have the $x$- and $y$- axes labelled appropriately? (0.1). Do all graphs have descriptive titles? (0.1)

Is there a null and alternative hypothesis appropriate for the data? (0.6)
