**Revised Bivariate Graphing Assignment** 

This is a continuation of the material submitted for the **Bivariate Graphing Assignment** submitted in week08.  You should revise your assignment as needed based on peer comments.  I encourage everyone to make an appointment with the writing center and to have the writing center review your current assignment.
